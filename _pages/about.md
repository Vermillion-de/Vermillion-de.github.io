Hi! My name is Qi Zhang, I am currently a fourth year undergraduate student in USTC, majored in informational and computational science. For the most of the time, I am nerd in CG, CV, 3D Vision.

In my free time, I am a super fan of MacOS, archlinux,  neovim (hacking cowboyü§†). I am also a fan of heavy music, movies, short marathon. At the same time, I have a minor interest in languages (Oui! Je parle Fr√†n√ßs peti!).

**Always actively looking for internships!** 

**Feel free to contact with me if you want to chat with me! My wechat ID is *qizhang_001*.**


<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
