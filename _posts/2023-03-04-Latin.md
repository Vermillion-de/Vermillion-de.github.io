Salvēte, et amīcī et amīcae meae!
It was a long time since I decided to learn Latin, it is a long, wonderful journey to understand so much in western culture.

## Main idea
This is a long story of learning latin.

Where shall we begin? I really do think the Carmina Burana by Carl Orff is a good example, where I take a example with the second.


## 

```
Fortune plango vulnera	I bemoan the wounds of Fortune
stillantibus ocellis	with weeping eyes,
quod sua michi munera	for the gifts she made me
subtrahit rebellis.	she perversely takes away.
Verum est, quod legitur,	It is written in truth,
fronte capillata,	that she has a fine head of hair,
sed plerumque sequitur	but, when it comes to seizing an opportunity
Occasio calvata.	she is bald.

In Fortune solio	On Fortune's throne
sederam elatus,	I used to sit raised up,
prosperitatis vario	crowned with
flore coronatus;	the many-coloured flowers of prosperity;
quicquid enim florui	though I may have flourished
felix et beatus,	happy and blessed,
nunc a summo corrui	now I fall from the peak
gloria privatus.	deprived of glory.
Fortune rota volvitur:	The wheel of Fortune turns;
descendo minoratus;	I go down, demeaned;
alter in altum tollitur;	another is raised up;
nimis exaltatus	far too high up
rex sedet in vertice	sits the king at the summit -
caveat ruinam!	let him fear ruin!
nam sub axe legimus	for under the axis is written
Hecubam reginam.	Queen Hecuba.
```

## End
Valete, amīcī et amīcae meae!
